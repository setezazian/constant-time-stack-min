# Constant Time Stack Min

Write a stack using your preferred instantiation pattern. Implement a min function
that returns the minimum value of all the elements in the stack in constant time.stack.

- All of the functions in the Stack should run in constant time!

```
var example = new Stack()
 example.push(4)
 example.push(3)
 example.min() === 3
 example.push(3)
 example.push(2)
 example.push(2)
 example.min() === 2
```
